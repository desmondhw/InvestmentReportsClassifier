# Classifying Investment Research Reports by Sectors and Market Sentiment using Text Analytics

Investment analysts at large buy-side financial institutions receive about 2,000 research reports daily from research institutions and other banks. Manually sorting and analyzing thousands of reports daily is time consuming, if not impossible.

We attempted to develop a solution that will (1) cluster research reports into their respective industry sectors, (2) carry out sentiment analysis to determine the investment sentiment of each report - 'Bullish' or 'Bearish'.
